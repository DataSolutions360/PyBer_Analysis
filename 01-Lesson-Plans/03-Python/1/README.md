# Module 3 Class 1: Python Fundamentals

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing the Python programming language. In this unit, students will learn to use the core Python language  to store and manipulate data, how to read and write to files, and how to "translate" logical solutions to problems.

In today's class, students will make sure Python is installed correctly, then they'll review how to create and execute Python files, create variables and determine the data types of variables, perform calculations using Python, work with lists and dictionaries, and use the Python `print()` function to print information to the screen. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:
 
* Verify that Python is installed correctly
* Understand Python data types
    * Variables
    * Lists
    * Dictionaries
* Understand printing formats
