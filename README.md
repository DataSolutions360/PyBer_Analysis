# Welcome to the Wonderful World of Bootcamp!

To get started using the repository, follow these steps:
1. Click the big green button that says **Code**
2. Make sure `SSH` is selected and then copy the address there starting with `git@github.com:`.
3. Open a terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (PC) and navigate to a location using `cd` where you want your repository to live. **NOTE: For PC users, it is best to not put the repository on your OneDrive.**
4. When you are in the correct folder (you can check using the command `pwd`), type the following command into the prompt: `git clone <InsertGitHubAddressHere>` (do not include <>).
5. Do not place any files in your repository (which is basically just a folder). This is just for class activities.
6. To update the repository, navigate to it's directory or any child directory and use the command `git pull.`

**Using GitHub for class is completely optional at this point and, and these are instructions for only those students familiar with the command line interface. If you are confused, that's ok. We will go over it later in class.**
